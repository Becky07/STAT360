```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


1. On which line does a get copied in the following example?
```{r}
a <- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
b <- a
b[[1]] <- 10
```

**Solution**: Line 3:

```{r}
a <- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
tracemem(a)
b <- a
tracemem(b)
b[[1]] <- 10
```

2. In the following code chunk, does `x` get copied? Does `ll` get copied? Does  `ee` get copied?
```{r}
x <- rnorm(100); y <- rnorm(100)
ll <- list(x=x,y=y)
ll$x <- 1:100
ee <- rlang::env(x=x,y=y)
ee$x <- 1:100
```

**Solutions** Use `tracemem()` on `x`, `y` and `ll` to see that only `ll` 
gets copied. (Recall that you can't put a trace on the environment `ee`.)

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100); y <- rnorm(100)
tracemem(x)
tracemem(y)
ll <- list(x=x,y=y)
tracemem(ll)
ll$x <- 1:100
ee <- rlang::env(x=x,y=y)
# tracemem(ee) 
## error: tracemem() can't apply to an environment
ee$x <- 1:100
```

3. Find the size of the objects x and y in the following code chunk.
Which is smaller? If instead of vectors from 1 to 10 they were vectors
from 1 to 1 million, which would be smaller?

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
y <- 1:10
```

**Solution** Use `lobstr::obj_size()` to see that `x` is actually 
smaller! However, for vectors of length 1 million `y` would be smaller. 
You can see this if, for example, you generate 1 million random numbers:

```{r}
# find size of x and y, one by one, with obj_size()
lobstr::obj_size(x)
lobstr::obj_size(y)
# output size of x and y simultaneously with obj_sizes(x,y)
# note that: obj_size(x,y) = obj_size(x)+obj_size(y)
lobstr::obj_sizes(x,y)

x <- rbinom(1e6,10,.5)
y <- 1:1e6
lobstr::obj_sizes(x,y)
```
