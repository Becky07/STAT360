## Short exercises based on chapters from text

1. Explain the output of the following code chunk.

```{r}
f <- function() {
  fe <- environment(f)
  ee <- environment()
  pe <- parent.env(ee)
  list(fe=fe,ee=ee,pe=pe)
}
f()
```

*Solution* The variable `fe` holds the environment of the function
`f`, which is the environment in which `f` was defined.
This is the global environment in this example. The variable `pe` holds
the parent environment of the environment inside `f`, which is the global environment.
The variable `ee` holds the environment within the function.

2. Read the help files on the `exists()` and
`get()` functions.
Explain the output of the following code chunk.

```{r}
f <- function(xx) {
  xx_parent <- if(exists("xx",envir=environment(f))) {
    get("xx",environment(f))
  } else {
    NULL
  }
  list(xx,xx_parent)
}
f(2)
xx <- 1
f(2)
rm(xx)
```

*Solution* On the first call to f xx does not exist
in the global environment, so `xx_parent` is NULL
in f. On the second call, xx does exists so 
`xx_parent` is its value in the global environment.

3. Write a function with argument `xx` that tests 
whether `xx` exists in the parent environment and, if so,
    (a) assigns the value of `xx` in the parent environment
    to the variable `xx_parent`, and
    (b) tests whether `xx` and `xx_parent` are equal. If 
    the test is FALSE, throw a warning to alert the user to
    the fact that the two are not equal.

*Solution* 

```{r}
f <- function(xx) {
  if(exists("xx",envir=environment(f))) {
    xx_parent <- get("xx",envir=environment(f))
    if(xx_parent != xx) {
      warning("xx value in global env is ",xx_parent," and xx value in f is ",xx,"\n")
    }
  }
}
f(1)
xx <- 2
f(1)
rm(xx)
```

4. Write an infix version of `c()` that concatenates
two vectors.

```{r}
`%c%` <- function(x,y) c(x,y)
1:3 %c% 4:6
```

## Map-Reduce

Refer to the Wikipedia page on algorithms for computing sample variances
and covariances: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance
We will implement the two-pass algorithm for computing the sample variance 
as a Map-Reduce.

1. Use the following code chunk from the lecture 4 notes to simulate
data in 10 chunks and calculate the overall sample mean.

```{r}
rfun <- function(seed,n) { set.seed(seed); return(rnorm(n))}
dat2 <- lapply(1:10,rfun,n=1e5) # apply rfun function with n=1e5 over 1:10
mfun2 <- function(x) { 
  return( data.frame(sum=sum(x),n=length(x)) ) }
sumdat <- lapply(dat2,mfun2) # apply mfun2 to each element of list "dat2"
simple_reduce <- function(x, f) { # Text section 9.5
  out <- x[[1]] 
  for (i in seq(2, length(x))) {
    out <- f(out, x[[i]])
  }
  out
}
allres <- simple_reduce(sumdat,rbind)
my_mean <- sum(allres[,"sum"])/sum(allres[,"n"]) # mean
```

2. Write a function that takes a vector and `my_mean` as input 
and returns 

(i) the sum of squared deviations between the vector's values
and `my_mean` and 

(ii) the number of vector values (n). 

*Solution*
```{r}
mfun3 <- function(x,my_mean) { 
  return(data.frame(sum=sum((x-my_mean)^2),n=length(x)))
  }
```

3. Use `lapply()` to call your function from (2) on each element of 
`dat2`. 

*Solution*
```{r}
sumdat <- lapply(dat2,mfun3,my_mean=my_mean)
```

4. Use `simple_reduce()` to combine your results into a single data frame, 
and calculate the sample variance from this data frame. Compare 
your answer to `var(unlist(dat2))`.

*Solution*
```{r}
allres <- simple_reduce(sumdat,rbind)
my_var <- sum(allres[,"sum"])/(sum(allres[,"n"])-1) 
 var(unlist(dat2)) # same
```


## Recursive partitioning

* The following code chunk is the start of an implementation
of recursive partitioning using a binary tree data structure
to store the partition.
* Binary trees can be implemented as a linked list of nodes that
contain 
    1. data
    2. a pointer to the left child
    3. a pointer to the right child
* For our recursive partitioning example, the data will be 
a region of the original covariate space and the response/covariate data
in that region.
* The following code chunk establishes node and region data structure.

```{r}
# Constructor for the node data structure:
new_node <- function(data,childl=NULL,childr=NULL){
  nn <- list(data=data,childl=childl,childr=childr)
  class(nn) <- "node"
  return(nn)
}
# The data stored in the node are a partition, or region of the 
# covariate space. Constructor for region data structure:
new_region <- function(coords=NULL,x,y){
  if(is.null(coords)) {
    coords <- Reduce(cbind,lapply(x,range))
  }
  out <- list(coords=coords,x=x,y=y)
  class(out) <- "region"
  return(out)
}
```

* Some tests of the above constructors are given in the next code chunk.

```{r}
set.seed(123); n <- 10
x <- data.frame(x1=rnorm(n),x2=rnorm(n))
y <- rnorm(n)
new_region(x=x,y=y)
new_node(new_region(x=x,y=y))
```

* The recursive partitioning function is shown below. We'll discuss
this in class.

```{r}
#---------------------------------------------------#
# Recursive partitioning function.
recpart <- function(x,y){
  init <- new_node(new_region(x=x,y=y))
  tree <- recpart_recursive(init)
  class(tree) <- c("tree",class(tree))
  return(tree)
}
recpart_recursive <- function(node) {
  R <- node$data
  # stop recursion if region has a single data point
  if(length(R$y) == 1) { return(node) } # NB: was return(NULL)
  # else find a split that minimizes a LOF criterion
  # Initialize
  lof_best  <- Inf
  # Loop over variables and splits
  for(v in 1:ncol(R$x)){ 
    tt <- split_points(R$x[,v]) # Exercise: write split_points()
    for(t in tt) { 
      gdat <- data.frame(y=R$y,x=as.numeric(R$x[,v] <= t))
      lof <- LOF(y~.,gdat) # Exercise: write LOF()
      if(lof < lof_best) { 
        lof_best <- lof
        childRs <- split(R,xvar=v,spt=t) # Exercises: write split.region()
      }
    }
  } 
  # Call self on best split
  node$childl <- recpart_recursive(new_node(childRs$Rl))
  node$childr <- recpart_recursive(new_node(childRs$Rr))
  return(node)
}
```

## Exercises

1. Write `split_points()`. The function should take 
a vector of covariate values as input and return the sorted 
unique values.  You will need to trim off the maximum unique value, 
because this can't be used as a split point. (As yourself why not.)
Write a snippet of R code that tests your function.
2. Write the function `LOF()` that returns the lack-of-fit criterion
for a model. The function should take a model formula and
data frame as input, pass these to `lm()` and return the
residual sum of squares. 
Write a snippet of R code that tests your function.
3. Write `split.region()`. The function should take a
region `R`, the variable to split on, `v`, and the split point, `t`,
as arguments. Split the region into left and right 
partitions and return a list of two regions labelled
`Rl` and `Rr`. Note: It is tempting to split the x and y data
and calculate the coordinates matrix from the x's, as the constructor
does when not passed a coordinates matrix. However, this will
leave gaps in the covariate space. (Ask yourself why.)
Write a snippet of R code that tests your function.
4. Run `recpart()` with your versions of `split_points()`,
`LOF()` and `split.region()`. Use the test data `x` and `y` 
defined in the testing code chunk. At this point you do
not need to check that the output is correct; you will get 
a chance to do that in lab 3.

```{r,eval=T}
split_points <- function(x) {
  x <- sort(unique(x))
  x <- x[-length(x)] # remove the last element which is the max in the list of unique values
  return(x)
}

LOF <- function(form,data) {
  ff <- lm(form,data)
  return(sum(residuals(ff)^2))
}

split.region <- function(R,xvar,spt){
  r1_ind <- (R$x[,xvar] <= spt)
  c1 <- c2 <- R$coords
  c1[2,xvar] <- spt; c2[1,xvar] <- spt 
  Rl <- new_region(c1,R$x[r1_ind,,drop=FALSE],R$y[r1_ind])
  Rr <- new_region(c2,R$x[!r1_ind,,drop=FALSE],R$y[!r1_ind])
  return(list(Rl=Rl,Rr=Rr))
}

test <- recpart(x,y)
```
