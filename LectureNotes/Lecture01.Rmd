# Course Objectives

## Course objectives

- Make you R **programmers** rather than just R **users**, by 
working through most of the book "Advanced R" by Hadley Wickham: https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html.Solutions to the exercises in the textbook is also available online for free: https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/ 
- Topics:
    - R objects: names and values
    - Basic data structures and programming.
        * vectors, subsetting, control flow, functions, environments
        * No tidyverse this time
    - R packages (based on the [online text](https://r-pkgs.org) 
    by Wickham and Bryan)
    - Object-oriented programming in R
    - Code performance: debugging, profiling, memory, calling 
    Python, or C++ from R
    - Parallelizing R code (if time permits)

## Courses Resources

- Lecture time: Tuesday, 12:30 - 2:20 PM at AQ3005. 
- Textbook and Solutions
  + Textbook: **Advanced R, 2nd ed.** By Hadley Wickham. Available online for free at https://adv-r.hadley.nz/
  + Exercise Solutions: **The Advanced R Solutions, 2nd ed.**. Also available online for free at: https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/
- Evaluations
  + In-class quizzes (50%): best 5 out of 6 quizzes. 
  + Group course project (20%).
  + Closed-book final exam (30%).

## Getting started with R, RStudio and git

- Follow the ``getting started'' instructions on the class canvas 
page to get set up with R, RStudio and git.
    * R and RStudio will be familiar, but you may not have used git
    before, so leave some time for that.
- Please try to get R and RStudio installed and create an RStudio project linked to the class GitHub 
repository (or a forked copy) as soon as possible. A document shows you steps how to access lecture notes and etc. Here is the link: https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/74856/files/20688259?wrap=1
- Those still having trouble after the lecture should ask our TA, Sidi Wu (wusidiw@sfu.ca),
for help during the first lab sessions this week. 
    - **Note: Lab starts from this week (week 2)**.


## Reading 

- Welcome, Preface and Chapters 1,2 of the text.

# Chapter 2 - Names and Values

## R objects

- In R, data structures and functions are all referred to 
as "\textcolor{red}{objects}".
- Objects are created with the assignment operator `<-` or `-`; e.g.,  
`x <- c(1,2,3)`.
    - The objects a user creates from the R console are contained in
    the user's workspace, called the global environment. 
    - Use \textcolor{blue}{'ls()`} to see a list of all objects in the workspace. 
    - Use \textcolor{blue}{'rm(x)'} to remove object `x` from the workspace.
    
## Digging deeper

* The above understanding is an over-simplification that
is usually OK, but will sometimes lead to misunderstandings
about  memory usage and when R makes copies of objects
* Object copying is a **major** source of computational overhead in R,
so it pays to understand what will trigger it.
- Reference: text, chapter 2

## Binding names and to objects

- The R code `x <- c(1,2,3)` does two things: 
  (i) creates an object in computer memory that contains the values 1, 2, 3 
  (ii) "binds" that object to the 
"name" `x`.

\small

```{r}
# install.packages("lobstr")
library(lobstr)
x <- c(1,2,3)
ls()
obj_addr(x) # changes every time this code chunk is run
```

\normalsize

## Binding multiple names to the same object

* The following binds the name `y` to the same object
that `x` is bound to.

\small

```{r}
y <- x
c(obj_addr(x), obj_addr(y))
```

\normalsize
![Bind two names to the same object](bind2.png){width=60%} 


## Aside: Syntactic *vs* non-syntactic

* Valid, or "syntactic" names in R can consist of letters, digits, . 
and _ but should start with a letter.
* Names that start with . are hidden from directory listing with `ls()`.
* Names that start with _ or a digit are non-syntactic and will cause
an error.
* If you need to create or access a non-syntatic name, use backward
single-quotes ("backticks").

\small

```{r}
x <- 1
.x <- 1
`_x` <- 1
ls()
```



## Modifying causes copying

* Modifying a variable causes a copy to be made, with the
modified variable name bound to the copy.

\footnotesize

```{r}
x <- y <- c(1,2,3)
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
y[[3]] <- 4 # Note: x[2] <- 10 has the same effect
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
```
\normalsize
![Bindings after copying](bindnew.png){width=40%} 

## Tracing copying

* The `tracemem()` function marks an object so that a message is printed
whenever a copy is made.

\small

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3)
tracemem(x)
x[[2]] <- 10
untracemem(x)  # remove the trace
x[[1]] <- 10
```

## More on `tracmem()`

* As the output of  `\textcolor{blue}{`tracemem()`} suggests, 
the trace is on the object, not the name:

\small

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3)
tracemem(x)
y <- x
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
y[[2]] <- 10
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
```


## Function calls

* R has a reputation for passing copies to functions, but in fact the
**copy-on-modify** applies to functions too:

\footnotesize

```{r}
f <- function(arg) { return(arg) }
x <- c(1,2,3)
y <- f(x) # no copy made, so x and y bound to same obj
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
f <- function(arg) { arg <- 2*arg; return(arg) }
y <- f(x) # copy made
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
```

## Lists

* List elements point to objects too:

\footnotesize


```{r}
l1 <- list(1, 2, 3)
rbind(obj_addr(l1),
      obj_addr(l1[[1]]),
      obj_addr(l1[[2]]),
      obj_addr(l1[[3]]))
# Note: ref(l1) will print a nicely formatted version of the above,
# but doesn't work with my slides
```


## Copy-on-modify in lists


\footnotesize

```{r}
l1 <- l2 <- list(1,2,3)
```

![Bindings before](listbind2.png){width=30%} 

```{r}
l2[[3]] <- 4
```

![Bindings after modify](listbindnew.png){width=30%} 

## Copies of lists are said to be "shallow"

* As shown above, we copy the list itself and any list **elements** that are modified. This is called a ``shallow" copy. 
* By contrast, a ``deep" copy would be a copy of all elements.

\footnotesize

```{r}
l1 <- list(1,2,3)
rbind(obj_addr(l1),obj_addr(l1[[1]]),
      obj_addr(l1[[2]]),obj_addr(l1[[3]]))
l1[[3]] <- 4 
rbind(obj_addr(l1),obj_addr(l1[[1]]),
      obj_addr(l1[[2]]),obj_addr(l1[[3]]))
```


## Data frames are lists with columns as list items 

\footnotesize

```{r}
dd <- data.frame(x=1:3,y=4:6)
c(obj_addr(dd[[1]]),obj_addr(dd[[2]]))
dd[,2] <- 7:9 # change a column
c(obj_addr(dd[[1]]),obj_addr(dd[[2]])) # only changes 2nd element
dd[1,] <- c(11,22) # change a row
c(obj_addr(dd[[1]]),obj_addr(dd[[2]])) # changes to both elements
dd[1,1] <- 111 # change one element
c(obj_addr(dd[[1]]),obj_addr(dd[[2]])) # only changes 1st element
```

## Beware of data frame overhead

* Data frames are convenient, but the convenience comes at a cost.
    * For example, coercion to/from lists

\footnotesize

```{r}
dd <- data.frame(x=rnorm(100)) # try yourself with rnorm(1e7)
tracemem(dd); tracemem(dd[[1]])
dmed <- lapply(dd,median) # makes a list copy of dd 
dd[[1]] <- dd[[1]] - dmed[[1]] #  
```

##

* Fewer copies if we do the same with a list.

\footnotesize

```{r}
ll <- list(x=rnorm(100))
tracemem(ll); tracemem(ll[[1]])
lmed <- lapply(ll,median) # no need for a list copy
ll[[1]] <- ll[[1]] - dmed[[1]]
```


## Modify-in-place

* The text says there are two exceptions to the copy-on-modify:
    1. Modify an element of an object with one binding, or 
    2. Modify an environment.
    
but in my experiments, only the second applies.

\footnotesize

```{r}
v <- c(1,2,3) # creates object (1,2,3) and binds v to it
tracemem(v)
v[[3]] <- 4 # for me, this triggers a copy

```

##

![environments](env1.png){width=40%} ![environments](env2.png){width=40%}

\footnotesize

```{r}
e1 <- rlang::env(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
e2 <- e1
# note: can't use tracemem() on an environment
e1$c <- 4
e2$c
```

## Object size

* Use `lobstr::obj_size()` to find the size of objects.

\footnotesize

```{r}
obj_size(dd)
obj_size(ll)
obj_size(e1)
obj_size(e2)
```
