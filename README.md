# Stat360 - Spring 2023 at SFU

This is the GitHub repository for Stat 360, spring 2023 at SFU.
The lecture notes are mostly taken straight out of professor Brad McNeney's notes, and many of the exercises are based on the text [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham. These materials are licensed under the same license as the source material. Many thanks for making my life easier.
